# Welcome to the Inxton Organization

Inxton is an umbrella organization for open-source and internal projects developed at [MTS](https://www.mts.sk/en/).  
Our projects primarily focus on industrial automation, including application frameworks, components, production data management, and related domains.

>[!NOTE]
> We are currently developing projects under different organizations on GitHub and will progressively transition them here.  
> This transition will take place over the coming months, with the primary goal of simplifying our internal workflows.

The transition will affect the following existing organizations:
- [TcOpenGroup](https://github.com/TcOpenGroup)  
- [AX# & AXOpen](https://github.com/ix-ax)  

**Once the transition is complete, all future development will take place here.  
There will be no changes to the licensing of any existing open-source projects.**

The libraries and tools formerly known as the Inxton Vortex Framework will remain within this organization, as they form the technological foundation for TcOpen.
However, there are currently no plans to open-source the Inxton Vortex Framework in its entirety.
