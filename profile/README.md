# Welcome to the Inxton Organization

Inxton is an umbrella organization for open-source and internal projects developed at [MTS](https://www.mts.sk/en/).  
Our projects primarily focus on industrial automation, including application frameworks, components, production data management, and related domains.

>[!NOTE]
> We are currently developing projects under different organizations on GitHub and will progressively transition them here.  
> This transition will take place over the coming months, with the primary goal of simplifying our internal workflows.

The transition will affect the following existing organizations:
- [TcOpenGroup](https://github.com/TcOpenGroup)  
- [AX# & AXOpen](https://github.com/ix-ax)  

**Once the transition is complete, all future development will take place here.  
There will be no changes to the licensing of any existing open-source projects.**

The libraries and tools formerly known as the Inxton Vortex Framework will remain within this organization, as they form the technological foundation for TcOpen.
However, there are currently no plans to open-source the Inxton Vortex Framework in its entirety.

## AX# and AXOpen projects

AX# and AXOpen are under development and they they are build on top of `SIMATIC-AX` platform.

**As SIMATIC AX is currently in a limited release phase, kindly take note of the following:**

**It is necessary to have a valid license for SIMATIC AX in order to use AX# and AXOpen!**  
SIMATIC AX is currently in a limited sales release in selected European countries only. You will need to request access from the AX team which will check if your use case is suitable for the current state of the product. The first step to getting the approval is contacting your local SIEMENS sales representative or writing an email to [simatic-ax@siemens.com](mailto:simatic-ax@siemens.com?subject=Request%20for%20access%20|%20SIMATIC%20AX%20for%20IX).
